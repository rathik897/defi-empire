# ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts Repository  

Welcome to the **ERC20 and Vault Contracts** repository! This project showcases a complete implementation of an ERC20 token and a Vault system to provide a secure and flexible ecosystem for token storage and management.  

---

## Overview  

### ERC20 Token Contract  
The ERC20 contract enables the creation of a fungible token adhering to the Ethereum ERC20 standard.  
**Key Features**:  
- **Standard Compliance**: Fully follows the ERC20 specification for compatibility with exchanges, wallets, and DeFi protocols.  
- **Custom Token Details**: Configure the token name, symbol, and initial supply during deployment.  
- **Ownership and Permissions**: Access-controlled functions for minting and burning tokens.  
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient implementation for reduced transaction costs.  

### Vault Contract  
The Vault contract acts as a secure storage mechanism for managing ERC20 tokens.  
**Key Features**:  
- **Deposit and Withdraw**: Seamlessly deposit ERC20 tokens and manage withdrawals.  
- **Access Control**: Restricted operations for privileged actions to ensure security.  
- **Time-Locked Withdrawals (Optional)**: Add functionality to enable controlled, delayed withdrawals.  
- **Auditable Ledger**: Maintain logs for deposits and withdrawals for transparency.

## Use Cases  
1. **Token Distribution**: Manage token supply and allocate tokens to stakeholders.  
2. **Secure Storage**: Use the Vault as a trustless way to lock tokens for users or governance purposes.  
3. **DeFi Integration**: Serve as a foundation for yield farming, staking, or liquidity pools.  


## Smart Contract Details  

### ERC20 Contract  
- **Name**: `TokenName`  
- **Symbol**: `TKN`  
- **Decimals**: `18`  
- **Initial Supply**: Configurable at deployment.  

### Vault Contract  
- Supports interaction with any compliant ERC20 token.
